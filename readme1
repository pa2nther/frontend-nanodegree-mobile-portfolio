Project 4 

Strategies I used to Optimize the Webpage

I repeatedly resized and optimized the images especially pizzeria to lower the PageSpeed insights score.

the scripts included were made async to reduce the load time

Used code from the Google website to delay css loading thru script. Added the css that seemed essential in the head. There was some duplication but wanted to make sure it could be applied to subsequent pages.

I took out some code from the for loop that didnâ€™t need to be repeated to fix the slider time. To improve the slider time. I changed some of the values used.
